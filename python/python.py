# Explain how python runs

# When running python hello.py for example, the system/environment launches the Python Interpreter
# Python reads the .py file as text
# Parses the file according to Python syntax rules
# Creates an Abstract Syntax Tree
#
# Python compiles the AST into bytecode â€” a set of low-level instructions for the Python virtual machine
# The python virtual machine has already been compiled so it then takes in byte code, and performs whatever compiled cpython function it needs to.
