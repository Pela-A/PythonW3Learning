# PythonW3Learning
The goal of this project is to expand my knowledge of Python. I want to understand the ins and outs of Python.

This is part of a greater initiative to understand code at a deep level

A fairly large amount of this I already know but this will help with quirks of language I might not know

After this I can go ham on Leetcode and DSA

TODO:
Review bitwise operations when appropriate time
